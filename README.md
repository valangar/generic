General JS codes on various topics!

- Some directories in this repo contain solutions to practice JS problems I found online.
	= I found these problems in one of the following places:
		i. https://javascript30.com/
		ii. Coming soon...
		
- I also have snippets of test solutions in a JSFiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/user/valangar/fiddles/
